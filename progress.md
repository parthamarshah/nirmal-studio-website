# Build progress

Section-by-section log. Update this after each phase lands. Full context/decisions
live in `CLAUDE.md` — read that first if you're picking this up cold.

## Resume here

Next up: **Task #8 — Process horizontal-scroll journey** (Section 8:
Discovery→...→Completion). Build mobile-first, run `npm run build && npm run lint`,
deploy via `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name nirmal-studio-website`,
commit + push, update this file.

Before starting Task #8, Parth still needs to re-verify the two fixes from this
session on his phone (floor-plan lightbox pan/zoom + close button, Philosophy's
border-only pill badges) — see the "Lightbox + Philosophy chip fixes" entry below for
exactly what changed. Also two things still waiting on him, unrelated to code: Tej's
sign-off on the Philosophy paragraph + IdeaTimeline stage copy (both generic "studio
voice," not confirmed facts), and confirming the Nishee House client is fine with
their full floor-plan layout being public.

Everything below is committed and pushed to `main`
(`github.com/parthamarshah/nirmal-studio-website`) and deployed at
`nirmal-studio-website.pages.dev` as of the last session.

## Done

- **Foundation** — Vite + React (plain JS) scaffolded. Installed `gsap`, `lenis`,
  `framer-motion`. Wired Lenis + GSAP ScrollTrigger scroll stack (`src/lib/scroll.js`),
  respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. Global palette/type/spacing tokens
  (`src/styles/tokens.css`) using the brief's cream/bronze/stone/beige palette —
  heading font is a serif placeholder pending the font-comparison pass. Content-as-data
  files created for projects, founders/FOLD, journal, testimonials
  (`src/data/*.js`) — journal and testimonials are empty arrays on purpose. Fixed a
  ticker-leak bug, a cursor-invisible-on-load bug, and a src/assets image-path
  convention that would have 404'd in production — see git log for details.
- **Repo + deploy pipeline** — pushed to
  `github.com/parthamarshah/nirmal-studio-website`. Wrangler CLI authenticated against
  the "Gurjar" Cloudflare account. Pages project `nirmal-studio-website` created and
  verified live at `nirmal-studio-website.pages.dev` (deploy via `npx wrangler pages
  deploy dist --project-name nirmal-studio-website` after each build phase).
  `nirmalstudio.com` custom domain is deliberately NOT yet attached — still showing
  Parth's Lovable placeholder until Hero is ready.
- **Fonts chosen** — Fraunces (heading), Syne (wordmark), via a live visual comparison
  page deployed to Pages and reviewed by Parth (page since deleted, decision baked into
  `src/styles/tokens.css` and `index.html`'s Google Fonts link).
- **Loader + Hero + Statement** — black-screen wordmark loader (skips entirely for
  `prefers-reduced-motion`), full-bleed Hero with a slow Ken Burns zoom on the Citadel
  Tower render (landscape for desktop, portrait crop for mobile via `<picture>`),
  scroll-triggered Statement fade-in. Extracted the Citadel Tower images from the
  source PDF into `public/images/citadel-tower/` — confirmed they actually resolve in
  the production build (`curl` 200, not just `npm run dev`). Added `scrollTo()` to
  `src/lib/scroll.js` (routes in-page navigation through Lenis instead of a native
  anchor jump, so scroll state doesn't desync) and a `--z-loader` token.
- **Custom cursor built, then removed** — a mouse-follow custom cursor was built
  (fixing two rounds of "invisible cursor" bugs along the way), then Parth reviewed it
  live and preferred the plain native cursor. Deleted `CustomCursor.jsx` and all
  related CSS/attributes/tokens entirely (not disabled — fully removed). See
  `CLAUDE.md`'s "No custom cursor" note — don't reintroduce without him asking again.
- **Focus-Image + Philosophy split-screen** — Section 3 (`FocusImage.jsx`): full-bleed
  scroll-scrubbed-parallax photo of the Terra Row Houses render (a father and son
  walking in), with a plain project-credit caption (name/type/location) rather than
  more "people/life" copy, since Hero and Philosophy already cover that idea. Section 4
  (`Philosophy.jsx`): split-screen, stacked on mobile/side-by-side from 768px, philosophy
  copy touching light/movement/context/materials/climate/vastu/lifestyle plus a row of
  theme tags. No real sketch/tracing-paper photography exists yet for the image half —
  used the Dolomite/Calcite Factory Office interior render instead (real project
  imagery, chosen because its stone/wood materiality actually matches the copy) behind
  a single swappable `project.heroImage` path, same pattern as Hero's media. While in
  the source PDF for these two, extracted every remaining image for all 7 confirmed
  projects (27 files, `public/images/<slug>/gallery-N.jpg`, via a one-off PyMuPDF
  script — `pdftoppm`/`pdfimages`/ImageMagick aren't installed on this machine,
  `pip install pymupdf` was) and listed them in each project's `gallery` array in
  `src/data/projects.js` — Task #9 (Featured Projects) now has real imagery for every
  project to pick from, not just this task's two curated picks (`heroImage` stays null
  for the 3 projects with no dedicated hero shot chosen yet — that's still a Task #9
  curation call, not this task's). Hero's CTA now points at `#philosophy` instead of
  `#statement`, since Philosophy is a better fit for "Our Approach" copy than the
  single-sentence Statement was. Later in the session, after Parth reviewed on his
  phone: replaced the theme-tag row's plain "Guided by" label + inline text list (felt
  like an afterthought, his words) with bordered pill badges above a divider line —
  more deliberate/designed presentation. Added `--color-bronze-darker` to
  `tokens.css` since the original `--color-bronze-dark` only hits ~4.1:1 against the
  chips' beige fill (a darker background than the page bg it was originally checked
  against), below AA for that size text.
- **Two new confirmed projects: Shimla House + Nishee House** — Parth confirmed these
  as genuine current Nirmal Studio work, sourced directly from him (not the PDF): a
  real floor-plan drawing for each (`public/images/shimla-house/` and
  `nishee-house/drawings-ground-floor.jpg`, one with "Architect: Nirmal Studio" on the
  title block) plus 11 AI-generated concept-visualization images he shared, which are
  explicitly **not** real design output — stored separately as `conceptArt` in
  `projects.js` (shared across both projects, since there's no way to tell which room
  belongs to which house from the files) and must always render with a visible
  "concept visualization" label, never mixed into `gallery`/`heroImage`. See
  `CLAUDE.md`'s Content rules for the full constraint — read that before touching
  either project's imagery. Confirmed project count is now 9, not 7.
- **Idea-to-Home timeline** (`IdeaTimeline.jsx`) — vertical scroll-reveal timeline,
  6 stages (Idea/Sketch/Model/Drawings/Construction/Finished Home), typographic per
  Parth's call except "Drawings," which shows the real Nishee House floor plan
  (`project.drawings`, content-as-data like every other section) cropped to drop the
  title block so the plan itself fills the frame. Parth confirmed on a real phone:
  room names (BEDROOM-1, LOUNGE, etc.) read fine inline, but the small dimension
  numbers under each label don't. Fixed with a tap-to-enlarge lightbox (tap the image
  → full-screen pan/scroll view at the drawing's natural pixel size, not fit-to-screen
  — fit-to-screen renders at the same size as inline on a phone, since inline is
  already width-constrained to the viewport). Note for Task #9: only Nishee
  House's drawing was cropped this way — Shimla House's (`public/images/shimla-house/
  drawings-ground-floor.jpg`) is still the full sheet with its title block, so the two
  will look inconsistent side by side until that's reconciled. A bronze line grows
  down a connecting
  track as you scroll, in sync with each stage fading in. Two real GSAP bugs came out
  of review and are now documented in
  CLAUDE.md's known-incident list so they don't recur silently: a `ScrollTrigger`
  `start`/`end` expressed as a fixed viewport percentage can be unreachable when the
  trigger element is the last thing on the page (the line could never finish filling,
  and the last stage could get stuck invisible on tall viewports) — fixed by prefixing
  values with `clamp(...)`. Also added the inline-style-beats-media-query cascade rule
  (from the Philosophy fix earlier this session) to that same list, since it wasn't
  written down anywhere before now.
- **Lightbox + Philosophy chip fixes, from Parth's phone review** — two rounds of
  review-agent findings (ux-reviewer, impact-tracker, edge-case-checker) surfaced real
  bugs beyond what Parth could see visually:
  - Lenis (global smooth-scroll) was hijacking desktop mouse-wheel input over the
    lightbox, scrolling the page behind it instead of panning the drawing — fixed with
    `data-lenis-prevent` on the overlay. Documented as a new CLAUDE.md known-incident
    pattern (any future `overflow: auto` overlay needs this, and it's easy to miss
    testing only on a phone since Lenis only intercepts wheel, not touch).
  - The lightbox's backdrop `onClick` was also firing when the click bubbled up from
    the drawing image itself — a double-tap-to-zoom gesture closed the lightbox on its
    first tap, before the zoom ever registered, defeating the whole feature. Fixed by
    gating the close handler on `e.target === e.currentTarget` (only a direct backdrop
    click closes it now).
  - The lightbox close button was `rgba(17,17,17,0.6)`, which nearly disappeared over
    the light/white areas that make up most of an architectural drawing. Bumped to
    0.85.
  - Philosophy's "bordered" pill badges had no actual border — just a `--color-beige`
    fill, which sits at ~1.2:1 contrast against `--color-bg` (near-identical
    lightness), so the redesign meant to fix "just left there" would have still read
    as barely-there on a real phone. Changed to border-only chips (`--color-bronze-darker`
    border, transparent fill) — this also fixes a second issue: a *filled* pill
    already means "tap this" elsewhere in the app (the lightbox trigger), so a filled
    static label was borrowing the wrong visual language. Restored a small "Guided by"
    eyebrow label above the row (removed in the first redesign pass) since bare
    uppercase words with no framing failed the first-time-user test — kept it visually
    distinct (smaller, letter-spaced, `--color-stone-dark`) from the original plain-text
    version Parth rejected, so it doesn't regress back to "afterthought."
  - Not yet fixed (non-blocking, flagged by review, worth remembering): no
    `role="dialog"`/focus-management on the lightbox (screen-reader/keyboard users get
    no modal cue), and no "drag to pan / pinch to zoom" affordance on lightbox open (a
    user landing on a zoomed-in corner of a 1584px-wide image with no cue that there's
    more to pan to could briefly read it as broken). Both are real but lower-severity —
    revisit in the polish pass, not blocking Task #8.

## Not started yet

- Featured Projects immersive storytelling section (raw image extraction from the PDF
  is done for all 7 projects — see `Done` above — but curating which shots become each
  project's hero/gallery lead, and writing challenge/materials/construction copy, is
  still this task's job)
- Studio (Tej Shah) + Network (FOLD) sections
- Process horizontal-scroll journey
- Journal + Testimonials (hidden until real content exists)
- Contact section
- Polish pass (perf/accessibility/SEO) + final comparison against the Lovable baseline video

# Build progress

Section-by-section log. Update this after each phase lands. Full context/decisions
live in `CLAUDE.md` — read that first if you're picking this up cold.

## Done

- **Foundation** — Vite + React (plain JS) scaffolded. Installed `gsap`, `lenis`,
  `framer-motion`. Wired Lenis + GSAP ScrollTrigger scroll stack (`src/lib/scroll.js`),
  respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. Custom cursor component (desktop/mouse only,
  `src/components/CustomCursor.jsx`). Global palette/type/spacing tokens
  (`src/styles/tokens.css`) using the brief's cream/bronze/stone/beige palette —
  heading font is a serif placeholder pending the font-comparison pass. Content-as-data
  files created for projects, founders/FOLD, journal, testimonials
  (`src/data/*.js`) — journal and testimonials are empty arrays on purpose. Fixed a
  ticker-leak bug, a cursor-invisible-on-load bug, and a src/assets image-path
  convention that would have 404'd in production — see git log for details.
- **Repo + deploy pipeline** — pushed to
  `github.com/parthamarshah/nirmal-studio-website`. Wrangler CLI authenticated against
  the "Gurjar" Cloudflare account. Pages project `nirmal-studio-website` created and
  verified live at `nirmal-studio-website.pages.dev` (deploy via `npx wrangler pages
  deploy dist --project-name nirmal-studio-website` after each build phase).
  `nirmalstudio.com` custom domain is deliberately NOT yet attached — still showing
  Parth's Lovable placeholder until Hero is ready.
- **Fonts chosen** — Fraunces (heading), Syne (wordmark), via a live visual comparison
  page deployed to Pages and reviewed by Parth (page since deleted, decision baked into
  `src/styles/tokens.css` and `index.html`'s Google Fonts link).
- **Loader + Hero + Statement** — black-screen wordmark loader (skips entirely for
  `prefers-reduced-motion`), full-bleed Hero with a slow Ken Burns zoom on the Citadel
  Tower render (landscape for desktop, portrait crop for mobile via `<picture>`),
  scroll-triggered Statement fade-in. Extracted the Citadel Tower images from the
  source PDF into `public/images/citadel-tower/` — confirmed they actually resolve in
  the production build (`curl` 200, not just `npm run dev`). Added `scrollTo()` to
  `src/lib/scroll.js` (routes in-page navigation through Lenis instead of a native
  anchor jump, so scroll state doesn't desync) and `--z-loader`/`--z-cursor` tokens.
  See "Known incident patterns" in `CLAUDE.md` — this phase re-triggered the
  cursor-invisible-on-load bug via a second, different mechanism (dark-on-dark
  contrast, not stacking) — fixed with `mix-blend-mode: difference` on the cursor dot.

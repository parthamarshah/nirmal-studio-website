# Build progress

Section-by-section log. Update this after each phase lands. Full context/decisions
live in `CLAUDE.md` — read that first if you're picking this up cold.

## Done

- **Foundation** — Vite + React (plain JS) scaffolded. Installed `gsap`, `lenis`,
  `framer-motion`. Wired Lenis + GSAP ScrollTrigger scroll stack (`src/lib/scroll.js`),
  respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. Custom cursor component (desktop/mouse only,
  `src/components/CustomCursor.jsx`). Global palette/type/spacing tokens
  (`src/styles/tokens.css`) using the brief's cream/bronze/stone/beige palette —
  heading font is a serif placeholder pending the font-comparison pass. Content-as-data
  files created for projects, founders/FOLD, journal, testimonials
  (`src/data/*.js`) — journal and testimonials are empty arrays on purpose. Fixed a
  ticker-leak bug, a cursor-invisible-on-load bug, and a src/assets image-path
  convention that would have 404'd in production — see git log for details.
- **Repo + deploy pipeline** — pushed to
  `github.com/parthamarshah/nirmal-studio-website`. Wrangler CLI authenticated against
  the "Gurjar" Cloudflare account. Pages project `nirmal-studio-website` created and
  verified live at `nirmal-studio-website.pages.dev` (deploy via `npx wrangler pages
  deploy dist --project-name nirmal-studio-website` after each build phase).
  `nirmalstudio.com` custom domain is deliberately NOT yet attached — still showing
  Parth's Lovable placeholder until Hero is ready.
